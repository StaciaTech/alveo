        <li>
          <strong>Consent:</strong> We process your personal data exclusively

          the specific purposes identified and communicated to you. We undertake
          not to process data beyond these stated purposes without obtaining
          further valid consent or establishing another legitimate legal basis.

              related information as prescribed by law.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Right to Correction and Erasure:</strong> You may request
              the correction of inaccurate or incomplete personal data, and the
              erasure of your personal data under specified circumstances (e.g.,
              when the data is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it
              was collected or when consent is withdrawn and no other lawful
              basis exists).

        commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the processing of
        your personal data, in strict alignment with the DPDP Act's requirements
        for Data Fiduciaries. Notwithstanding our rigorous efforts, it must be
        acknowledged that no method of data transmission over the Internet or
        electronic storage can guarantee absolute security. Consequently, while
        we endeavor to employ commercially acceptable means to protect your
        personal data, we cannot warrant its absolute security.
